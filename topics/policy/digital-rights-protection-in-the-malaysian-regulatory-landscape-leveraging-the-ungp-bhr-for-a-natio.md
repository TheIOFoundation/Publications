## About

## 1. Executive summary

This Policy Brief consolidates the proposed recommendations from The IO Foundation (TIOF), a Tech NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights, to incorporate technology as a cross-cutting issue in the upcoming National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights in Malaysia in its first iteration.

\


It is the result of 4 years of advocacy, research and engagement on BHR in the Tech sector in Malaysia and is unique in the sense that it is a document written from the perspective of technologists. Since its inception, TIOF has identified that the most significant gap in (Data-Centric) Digital Rights advocacy is the perspective from the builders and developers of these technologies ‚Äî the technologists.

\


While it was the wish of The IO Foundation for this initial iteration of the NAP to develop a full thematic area on Technology, which has been the focus of TIOF‚Äôs efforts, we encourage the Malaysian government and working parties to, at least, incorporate Technology as a cross-cutting issue. That is, as a subject that can be identified in all considered thematic areas as the source of challenges that can be remediated through the UNGPs.

\


This Policy Brief builds on the work of policy documents and toolkits that have been developed before by various policy professionals. While the United Nation Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights apply to all business sectors, this document focuses on the technology business in particular. Due to the niche scope of this topic within the Business and Human Rights space, it is perhaps easier to understand this brief as an effort for mainstreaming (Data-Centric) Digital Rights into all areas of public policy as part of the Information and Communications Technology sector‚Äôs duty of care for digital citizens.

\


The stakeholders for this Policy Brief are as follows:

Note

In the interest of brevity, this Policy Brief concentrates in providing Recommendations in a summarized way. Further implementation details can be provided once the NAP working group decides on which Recommendations to incorporate.

## 2. Background

The [UNGPs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8NH-zWoPxQMLOx6QXwSr0btYyWZnvvHz-oUMZZ7M78/edit#bookmark=kix.ghu57zc5ur5z) were endorsed by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in June 2011‚Äî it was a historic event in the adoption of human rights standards to private business actors, raising their responsibility and accountability alongside the government‚Äôs duty to protect the rights of citizens.

\


With businesses as a major driver for economic growth and infrastructure, the UNGPs became a necessary component to support national development agendas such as the digital transformation plans, that put citizens‚Äô well-being first. When a nation endorses a global framework such as the UNGPs, they further anchor that commitment in the form of National Action Plans (NAPs). Though, unfortunately, not a legally binding instrument, it is essential in promoting possible frameworks that the private sector could consider in positioning themselves as businesses that care about holistic development.

Alongside the UNGPs, the United Nations also adopted the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) with a list of components that make up the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is done in recognition of the important role that the private sector plays in promoting and implementing sustainable development. While the SDGs have been more popular amongst businesses and organizations worldwide, the adoption of the UNGPs has been slower. The UNGPs have relied on national commitments to adopt and implement them. Those initiatives would later be adopted by the private sector, once the governments finalizes and publishes their NAPs.

\


The main areas of concern for the general end users of digital technologies often come back to privacy protection. There is a growing concern over how information is collected, stored, and used by owners of digital platforms. While existing legislative developments in this area provide the basic principles for data protection, there is much room for improvement to better protect users of digital technologies in Malaysia. When all is said and done, what we are working towards is making Digital Rights protection work easily and seamlessly for regular end users.

\


National action plans (NAPs) on business and human rights are policy documents in which a government articulates priorities and actions it will take to protect human rights from business-related activities. As of 1 June 2020, NAPs have been adopted in 24 states around the world. However, few of these NAPs currently address the specific impacts on human rights by the use of digital technologies in the public and private sector, even though the potential scope of these impacts is very wide. Governments and tech companies can play a positive role in enabling the exercise of human rights in the digitalization of their services, but they can also pose risks to them.

\


Evidently, technological innovation has spurred the need for new laws and regulations that would ensure accountability of technology use via legal instruments. Even though the Malaysian government has taken steps to enable digital transformation and promote digital adoption by passing laws and policies that were intended to protect all parties engaged in digital transactions, there is still ample space for improvements.

\


The advocacy of human rights protection in the digital space, popularly known as Digital Rights advocacy, is gaining momentum globally. By and large, Digital Rights organizations have focused on legislative measures to protect the rights of people using digital technologies, especially when interacting with other parties on the Internet. More legislations, regulations, and policies have emerged in recent years to give a reference to what rights people have that are to be protected by the issuing authorities, how to exercise those rights, and the provision of penalties for non-compliance.

\


The IO Foundation has however identified a major problem in this approach: in the case of civilian consumption technology, these legislations, regulations and policies are not issued alongside technical specifications for their implementation. This creates an inevitable loophole that refrains:

* a standard implementation across technology products;
* the verification of claims of compliance through standard methodologies;
* technologists from creating products that protect Rights by design.

\


This is in stark contrast with any other adequately regulated product where companies never need to compete at compliance level: their products need to meet that basic criteria before they can compete in the market of ideas through their value propositions.

\


This creates challenges in promoting and strengthening both Rights (Human and Digital) and vibrant digital economies that concentrate on innovative value propositions while respecting Rights.

\


The IO Foundation works towards resolving this problems by:

* recognizing that data is only valuable when sufficiently contextualized and thus positing that one‚Äôs data is oneself (‚ÄúI am my data‚Äù);
* that technology has the capacity to preemptively eliminate harms (especially Digital Harms) and thus drastically reducing the need for remedy;
* that, given a certain jurisdiction, the applicable protections given to its citizens should be transparently implemented in the technology they use (‚ÄúRights by design‚Äù)

\


Data being the core component that represents citizens (in the shape of models called Digital Twins), TIOF has approached this challenge from a Data-Centric Digital Rights perspective; that is, the attempt to enact the protection of Rights through a framework that allows&#x20;

\

The UNGPs provide a suitable framework to combine Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights when applied to the tech sector.

Note:&#x20;

While currently not fully developed, the Framework provides a structured approach to protecting Rights and is used as guidance across this Policy Brief.

Technology in existing National Action Plans

The Malaysian NAP should make reference to technology inclusions in existing National Action Plans:

\


1. Japan. ‚ÄúIn terms of the development of artificial intelligence (AI), a Council for Social Principles of Human-centric AI was established for the purpose of considering the basic principles for implementing and sharing AI in society in a better way under the AI Strategy Expert Meeting for Strength and Promotion of Innovation.‚Äù&#x20;

\


2. &#x20;Colombia. ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Telecommunications \[Mintic] will elaborate the ‚ÄúGuide on Human Rights and Business: A document on the application of human rights and business principles‚Äù for the specific context of the Information and Telecommunications Technologies (ICT) sector.‚Äù

\


3. Luxembourg. ‚Äú1.15. Protection of human rights in business in the context of new information and communication technologies (ICT), including artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äù

## 3. Methodology

This Policy Brief is produced through 2 approaches:

\


1\) Cross-referencing the UNGPs against legislations that govern data and/or digital technologies in Malaysia:

TIOF conducted a policy review of three main pieces of legislation that govern data and/or digital technologies in Malaysia. The legislations are the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010, the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) 1998, and the Technologists and Technicians Act (TTA) 2015. This part of the research was specifically looking for Rights protection of citizens‚Äô data, who we call Digital Twins, and analyze for possible gaps in the policies.

\


2\) Applying the principles behind the DCDR Framework:

TIOF analyzed the existing plans for Malaysia‚Äôs digital development and identified a number of opportunities to ensure the protection of Rights for its citizens and their data through the UNGPs.

## 4. Research background

### 4.1 Rights in the PDPA Who‚Äôs protected and who‚Äôs not?&#x20;

When compared to the principles outlined in the UNGP BHR, it was found that the PDPA does provide a minimum standard of protection for the protection of personal data processed in Malaysia. There are, however, critical areas of legislative improvement necessary to keep up with the technological advancements of our time.&#x20;

\


The PDPA defines personal data as any information in respect of commercial transactions (Section 4), which:

1. is being processed wholly or partly by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose; or
2. is recorded with the intention that it should wholly or partly be processed by means of such equipment; or&#x20;
3. is recorded as part of a relevant filing system or with the intention that it should be part of a relevant filing system, that relates directly or indirectly to a data subject, who is identified or identifiable from that information or from that and other information in the possession of a data user.

\


In other words, personal data is any information that could identify a person, who resides within or outside of Malaysia, for as long as the data of that person is being processed in Malaysia in a machine-readable format

\


The person whose data it belongs to is called the ‚Äúdata subject‚Äù, while the person who is collecting, processing, and analyzing the data is called a ‚Äúdata user‚Äù. All this only applies to data used for commercial purposes, and does not apply to the Federal Government and State Governments as per Section 3 (1) of the Act. Furthermore, this law does not apply to personal data processed outside of Malaysia (Section 3\[2]), leaving Malaysians dependent on the personal data protection laws of whichever countries their data resides.

\


In line with [TIOF‚Äôs DCDR Principle I](https://tiof.click/Principles) of ‚ÄúI am My Data‚Äù, we will be referring to ‚Äúdata subjects'' as ‚Äúdata owners'' to provide a more accurate representation of the digital reality we live in. It is essential to convey the right ideas and concepts to the public for their increased awareness on the subject. The term ‚Äúdata subject‚Äù is not only inaccurate to represent the reality of how our (digital) data relates to our physical bodies, it poses a big challenge to the proper legislative protections of our data.

\


In the PDPA, the rights protected of data owners are as follows:

| Item                                                                                                      | Section    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Right to correct personal data                                                                            | 11; 34     |
| Right to withdraw consent to process personal data                                                        | 38 (1)     |
| Right to be notified of how their data will be processed and used (under the Notice and Choice Principle) | 7 (1)      |
| Right to choose how their data will be processed and used (under the Notice and Choice Principle)         | 7 (1)      |
| Right to non-disclosure of personal data without consent                                                  | 8 (1)      |
| Right to be forgotten (under the Retention Principle)                                                     | 10 (1)     |
| Right to access personal data                                                                             | 12; 31 (1) |

Table 4.1 - Rights of PDPA data owners

\


As for data users, they are obliged by the law to adhere to the seven (7) data protection principles that outline what they can or cannot do with regards to the personal data that they have access to. However, there are exceptions to these principles whereby the data user may not be liable to a violation of the principles under circumstances described in the accompanying sub-sections. A summary of the principles, their descriptions, and caveats are outlined below:

\


| Principle         | Section | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Caveat(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Table 4.2 - PDPA‚Äôs data protection principles

\


Based on what we have seen in the PDPA, the loopholes that exist within the legislation would put data owners at more of a disadvantage than its opposite. From a practical standpoint, this is primarily due to the fact that data owners are not recognised by law as the owners of their data, so their data is not recognized as part of them, and merely exist as ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù of the data they rightfully own. As a result, the law views digital citizens as separate from the human beings, who are the source and rightful owners of the data extracted from them.

\


This point is important to note because without contextualizing data back to its source, data becomes meaningless, and quite utterly useless. There is no business value to be extracted from useless data, therefore the recognition of the source entity and digital entity relationship is crucial for States to provide adequate domestic policy space to meet the human rights obligations of businesses (UNGP 9).&#x20;

\


***

\


Correcting the current paradigm on data is necessary for the correct implementation of data protection in digital spaces.

***

\


On more granular standpoints, exceptions to the rule, or caveats, within the PDPA pose risks to digital rights protection of technology users who are already legally disadvantaged for not being the rightful owners of their own data, apart from other disadvantages such as the costly nature of legal remedies. Some of the caveats are too dangerously broad to provide even the minimum protection, with clauses such as Section 39 (4) which allows data users to disclose personal information to a third party if it is within their ‚Äúreasonable belief‚Äù that they ‚Äúwould have had the consent of the data owner if the data owner had known the circumstances of the disclosure‚Äù, which means citizens are expected to extend complete trust in the judgment of the data users to determine if we ‚Äúwould have consented‚Äù and if we ‚Äúhad known‚Äù about ‚Äúthe circumstances‚Äù. These types of ambiguous clauses cast a big shadow of doubt into the ability of the legislation to protect the data of citizens and ultimately on the State‚Äôs duty to protect (UNGP Pillar 1) citizens from businesses‚Äô failure to respect (UNGP Pillar 2) our human right to privacy.

### 4.4 DCDR Framework

The Data-Centric Digital Rights Framework represents an attempt to model the protection of data through the use of standard definitions and methodologies.

\


While a full presentation and analysis of the DCDR Framework is out of the scope of this Policy Brief, the following are the main applicable considerations.

\


#### 4.4.1 DCDR Principles applied to the BHR Pillars

**4.4.1.1 Pillar I: State Duty to Protect**

DCDR Principle I: ‚ÄòI am My Data‚Äô - Treat data as you'd want to be treated.

The traditional understanding of data as separate entities from their users is anchored in past perceptions and the use of legacy technologies.

The reality is much different: the data representing users (and of which they should have control of consent) is intimately and inextricably linked to them; it models them, creating an accurate representation that loses all value should that contextualization ever be severed.

**4.4.1.2 Pillar II: Corporate Responsibility to Respect**

DCDR Principle II: ‚ÄòRights by Design‚Äô - Leave no policy uncoded behind.

This DCDR Principle responds to the need for policies and tech to be designed and implemented as one: the former establishes what is to be respected and the latter ensures that the compliance is built in the infrastructure so that users are protected automatically and transparently.

**4.4.1.3 Pillar III: Access to Remedy**

DCDR Principle II: End Remedy - Adopt designs that minimize grievances.

This DCDR principle represents the embodiment of the proactive planification, architecture and implementation of all necessary mechanisms, both in policy and technology, to avoid grievances to ever happen during the use of a product or a service, in turn minimizing the need for legal actions. In other words, any protection a citizen or its digital twins are subjected to under a specific jurisdiction should be transparently implemented inside the technology itself, by design.

#### 4.4.1 DCDR applied to the UNGPs

Historically speaking, the traditional Digital Rights advocacy has concentrated its advocacy in the observance of Human Rights through the use of technology, as a medium; it has had very little interest on how the medium itself was built and operated technically.

Consider the following diagram:

\


Image 4.1 - Spaces and Entities

\
\


On the left, the Physical Space, are 2 (physical) entities, which for the purposes of this Policy Brief we can consider citizens, the government or a corporation.

\


On the right, the Digital Space, are represented the Digital Twins of the 2 entities.

In the case of citizens, this would be one of their numerous data representations and in the case of governments and corporations the digital twin encompases the digital platforms and services they provide.

\


All of these objects (the entities and their digital twins) interact with each other, potentially generating harms. The traditional Digital Rights approach provides no clarity as to how to define these harms in a way that can be expressed technically and therefore understood by technologists.

\


When attempting to structure how the UNGPs could protect both the Rights of citizens and their data, The IO Foundation analyzed the scenario in Image 4.1 by categorizing the interactions between the Physical and Digital spaces as source and receiver of a given Harm.

Table 4.3 - DCDR Harms Matrix

\


Following Table 4.3, it is now easier to understand and define Human Rights as the proactive attempt to avoid harms received by a physical entity.

\


Image 4.3 - Human Rights

\


In similar fashion we can define Data-Centric Digital Rights as the proactive attempt to avoid harms received by a digital twin (which is likely to translate into a Human Right at some point).

\


Image 4.3 - Data-Centric Digital Rights

\


Combining both concepts provides a general approach to observe and implement both Human Rights and Data-Centric Digital Rights through the implementation of the UNGPs on BHR in the Tech sector.

## 5. NAP Recommendations

In its current iteration, the Malaysian National Action Plan will be focusing in the following 3 thematic areas:

\


* Governance
* Labor
* Environment

\


The following are the Recommendations made by The IO Foundation to protect the rights of citizens‚Äô and of their data (which conforms their digital twins).

\


For ease of reference, Recommendations are coded as: NAPR.Number

Where:

* NAPR = National Action Plan Recommendation
* Number = Sequential number corresponding to that of the document section

### 5.1 Thematic Area: Governance

#### 5.1.1 Overall impact

Observing the impact of technology is core to implementing the UNGPs in Malaysia‚Äôs governance.

\


The following are some of the aspects in which technology influences governance:

* The nature of data and its treatment
* The lack of definition of Digital Harms
* The lack of technical language to involve technologists

#### 5.1.2 Recommendations

The following are Recommendations aimed at supporting the UNPGs in this thematic area.

**5.1.2.1 Protection of citizens data**

The protection of Malaysia's citizen‚Äôs data is core to being able to protect their rights and implement the UNGPs. For as long as the nature of data is not properly understood and recognized by the government, it will not be possible to mitigate Harms (both physical and digital) inflicted to its citizens through the implementation of Rights.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.1] Recognize the true nature of data.

Initiate a program to recognize the inextricable connection between citizens and their data in order to protect both. This recognition should propagate through existing and future regulations as well as shape the national digital infrastructure.

See also Further recommendations.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.2] Protect citizen data on their devices.

Establish a national regulation covering the proper procedures to hand over devices for repair. Initiate programs to train shops that engage in repairs to follow a proper manipulation protocol that will protect citizens from data stealth.

Consider implementing a grading system similar to the existing one in the Food Hygiene Regulations (FHR) 2009.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.3] Research on DCDR.

Initiate a program to support the research of the components required to translate the existing regulations on technology into technical terms around the Data-Centric Digital Rights Framework.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.4] Issue a DR SDK.

Initiate a program to implement the results of the DCDR research into a (Data-Centric) Digital Rights Software Development Kit (DR SDK) which is to be distributed for adoption by the Malaysian tech sector.

Aside from resolving the current problem of verification of claims of compliance, it would also provide a standard way to perform a Digital Rights Impact Assessment (DRIA)

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.5] Expand the National Data Agency.

Expand the capacities of JPDP so that it can oversee the maintenance, deployment and usage of the DR SDK.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.1.6] Redefine the actors in data protection policies.

\

\


**5.1.2.2 Revisit Malaysia‚Äôs National Tech Infrastructure**

Upscaling Malaysia‚Äôs digital infrastructure towards observing and implementing the UNGPs should also be encouraged. While Malaysia has its own Digital Economy Blueprint, the text fails to provide the necessary infrastructure to observe, let alone implement the UNGPs.

\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.1] Establish Process-driven Governance.

Initiate a program through MAMPU to translate all government‚Äôs processes and existing regulations into BPMN.&#x20;

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.2] Government digital services monitoring.

Provide a government led monitor that allows to observe status of the government‚Äôs services (Websites, APIs, etc.).

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.3] Commit to a high SLA for the national digital infrastructure.

Recognizing the critical role that the national digital infrastructure plays in citizens, commit to a 97% SLA for the government‚Äôs online services.

This number represents 1 full natural day of downservice (per service) across a full natural year.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.4] Protect Internet Namespaces.

Considering the emergence of alternative naming protocols, ensure the current namespace (DNS) is not threatened through the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) at ICANN. Preserving a consistent user experience will result in minimizing the likelihood of digital attacks on citizens..

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.5] Monitor Internationalized domain names (IDNs)

With the imminent deployment of IDNs by ICANN, it will be crucial to ensure it does not open the doors for digital attacks on citizens.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.6] Citizen network.&#x20;

Initiate a program to assess how to complement Malaysia‚Äôs digital infrastructure through the use of its citizens‚Äô devices. See Environment

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.7] Enable and encourage citizens VPS.

Initiate a program to enable and encourage citizens to run their own VPS with their data.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.8] Establish data embassies.

Initiate a program to establish territorial legitimacy over servers holding data of Malaysian citizens abroad.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.9] Explore Digital Taxes in hardware for digital companies.

Initiate a program to explore the possibility to apply a digital tax that would compel tech companies hoping to transact with Malaysian citizens into supplying proportional infrastructure. Consider the possibility of GLCs as a starting point.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.2.10] Explore an Open Source revival program.

Initiate a program to explore the possibility of compelling tech companies to release the source code of products should they go out of business and certain criterias of dependence have been reached.

**5.1.2.3 Transparency and Accountability**&#x20;

Technology can enable the government to effectively increase its transparency and accountability in accordance with its National Anti-corruption Plan.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.1] Upscale Open Data government efforts.

Consolidate the Open Data portals that the government is currently offering.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.2] Improve ODIN score

Invest efforts in improving Malaysia‚Äôs current ODIN score.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.3] Public registry of government databases.

Governance bodies should publish which databases they have provided they are not under the Secrets Act.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.4] Publish Policies in machine-readable formats.

Establish a mechanism to publish policies in a machine-readable format so that they can be processed and referenced more efficiently.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.5] Use of BPMN to define processes

Leverage on \[NAPR.5.1.2.2.1] to increase transparency and accountability in government processes.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.6] Include technologists in tech consultations.

Increase the participation of the tech Civil Society (such as tech communities and tech NGOs) and industry representatives in policy making affecting the Malaysian tech sector.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.7] Publishing of tech-related regulations

Ensure the publication and easy access of all tech-related regulations. At the time of writing, the National Data Sharing Policy (NDSP) has been announced yet the text is nowhere to be found. A similar situation happens with the upcoming revision of the PDPA of which the final draft, to our knowledge, hasn‚Äôt been circulated.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.8] HRIAs & DRIAs

Conduct periodic Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) and (Data-Centric) Digital Rights Impact Assessments (DRIAs). The adoption of the DR SDK would enable a systematic monitoring of the impact of the UNGPs.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.9] National registry of data breaches

Create a national registry of reported data breaches affecting Malaysian citizens, both domestically and internationally.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.3.10] National Tech Ecosystem registry.

Create a national registry mapping the Malaysian tech ecosystem (from companies, associations, tech communities, IT Clubs, tech NGOs, etc.) that will include both registered and informal organizations. This registry would be used as a reference to implement \[NAPR.5.1.2.3.6].

**5.1.2.4 Educational pipeline**

An effective implementation of the UNGPs in Malaysia will necessitate awareness and training for all involved stakeholders. This is particularly true of the government itself and of technologists, which The IO Foundation regards as the Next Generation of Rights Defenders.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.4.1] Recognition of NextGen Rights Defenders.

\[Pending]

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.4.2] Introduce UNGPs and related subjects.

Produce and implement programs to incorporate Human Rights, (Data-Centric) Digital Rights and the UNGPs into the tech educational pipeline.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.4.3] Include Digital Literacy and UNGPs in all government agencies.

Produce and implement programs to incorporate Digital Literacy, Human Rights, (Data-Centric) Digital Rights and the UNGPs in all government agencies.

This will be crucial moving forward to not only expect the adoption of the UNGPs but also in the work to be done in the future for future iterations of the NAP.

**5.1.2.5 Amendments to existing tech regulation**

Certain existing regulations may require small amendments to ensure they support the implementation of the UNGPs.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.5.1] In general, however, The IO Foundation recommends ensuring that, moving forward, tech-related legislation incorporates the UNGPs.

\


PDPA

Aside from the [comments submitted during the Public Consultation on PDPA ](https://tiof.click/DCDRPubPDPA20200)invited by the Data Protection Commissioner in 2020, The IO Foundation proposes the following recommendations (without the knowledge of the provisions in the upcoming PDPA version):

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.5.2] Codify the ‚ÄòI am My Data‚Äô principle into law.

Citizens' data should be recognised as part of themselves so that any constitutional laws in the jurisdiction covers citizens‚Äô data as much as it covers their physical bodies. When the data of citizens is recognised as part of themselves, existing legal frameworks that protect citizens‚Äô human rights can be automatically applied to their digital twins, ensuring the protection of citizens‚Äô digital rights. For PDPA to effectively protect Malaysian citizens and uphold their Rights, it is crucial that the true nature of data is legally recognized.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.5.3] Cross-border protections.

Secure bilateral mechanisms to ensure that, in the event of an inevitable cross-border data transfer from Malaysian citizens, the recipient legislation enjoys at least the same protections that PDPA confers.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.5.4] Include data managed by the government.

Section 3 (1) of the PDPA remains one of the biggest challenges to comprehensive data protection in Malaysia. It also brings confusion to public citizens when government bodies cite their commitment to the PDPA without actually being legally liable to adhere to it. This situation could have detrimental consequences to the citizens‚Äô ability to trust the government with the protection of their data. Malaysian lawmakers have to amend this section of the PDPA to remove the non-application of the act to Federal and State government bodies.

\


\[NAPR.5.1.2.5.5] Expand the definition of ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù.

The definition of ‚Äòpersonal information‚Äô should not only be full names, phone numbers, national identification numbers, location data, etc., it should also include information inferred from the personal information collected in the service of surveillance and profiling purposes which could be potentially abused. In other words, personal information is not just objective information that platforms know about us, but also what their systems and/or algorithms learn about us from different data sources that are, knowingly or unknowingly, linked together

\


Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint

\[PENDING]

### 5.2 Thematic Area: Labor

#### 5.2.1 Overall impact

Observing the impact of technology is core to implementing the UNGPs in Malaysia‚Äôs labor sector.

\


The following are some of the aspects in which technology influences labor:

* The protection of labor relations
* The protection of laborers‚Äô digital twins

#### 5.2.2 Recommendations

The following are Recommendations aimed at supporting the UNPGs in this thematic area.

**5.2.2.1 Algorithm transparency & contracts**

\[NAPR.5.2.2.1.1] Transparent Gig-economy algorithms

Establish mechanisms to ensure that workers are not taken advantage of and their Rights are not observed and implemented.

\


Establish the necessary mechanisms to

* \[NAPR.5.2.2.1.2] articulate contracts via BPMN&#x20;

This would allow to easily reduce potential abuses towards the worker as well as corruption.

* \[NAPR.5.2.2.2.1] enable the codification of contracts via SmartContracts or similar technology.

This would immensely reduce the need for remedy and serve as proof of contractual status, which also serves to combat corruption.

**5.2.2.3 Legal Liability**

\[NAPR.5.2.2.3.1] Establish a professional association of developers.

Initiate the mechanisms to study and eventually implement the Malaysian professional association of developers.

Despite the rejection of the Computing Professionals Bill of 2011, the crucial role that technology plays in the proper implementation of the UNGPs demands to reconsider the need for such a regulatory body. Such organizations exist for architects, lawyers or healthcare practitioners. The reason why it is so obvious in such cases is only due to the fact that people can intimately relate to the Harms they can cause. While this is a complex subject, implementing \[NAPR.5.1.2.1.3] and \[NAPR.5.1.2.1.4] would largely help in making this association possible.

**5.2.2.4 Amendments to existing labor regulation**

\


Contract Act

\[NAPR.5.2.2.4.1] Modernize contracts and their structure

In addition to \[NAPR.5.2.2.1.2] and \[NAPR.5.2.2.2.1], implement the necessary mechanisms to define contracts that are

* schema-driven
* provide visual cues such as Consent Commons does for Data Protection Laws

This would allow enforcing the minimum information legally expected while severely reducing abuses to the workers and facilitate statistical analysis.

\


\[NAPR.5.2.2.4.2] BOYD and workers

Make provisions so that companies implementing a Bring Your Own Device (BOYD) policy need to compensate the worker in a similar manner than when they use their own vehicles and get paid by mileage.

### 5.3 Thematic Area: Environment

#### 5.3.1 Overall impact

Technology needs to be considered in their impact on implementing the UNGPs in Malaysia‚Äôs environment.

\


The following are some of the aspects in which technology influences environment:

* The impact on minerals‚Äô extraction
* The impact on technology recycling
* The protection of the environment‚Äôs digital twins

#### 5.3.2 Recommendations

The following are Recommendations aimed at supporting the UNPGs in this thematic area.

**5.3.2.1 Recycling of devices**

\[NAPR.5.2.2.4.2] Establish a&#x20;

\


CSM could be tasked to detach members or provide the service of wipeout and ensure that no malware/spyware is installed in the device.

\


Repair Mode >> Protocols for full lifecycle

Google. Apple, FAIR Phone, Local Malaysian brands

\>> MCMC

\


Would serve as the basis for a nation-wide DLT that is supported by its citizens as a national duty.

This could have further ramifications in the area of Labor as the citizen would be generating labor for the government.

\


**5.3.2.2 Amendments to existing environmental regulation**

None.

\


## 6. Further recommendations

The following are a series of recommendations that, beyond the current National Action Plan, can support the implementation of the UNGPs in the tech sector in Malaysia.

\


For ease of reference, Recommendations are coded as: OTHR.Number

Where:

* OTHR = National Action Plan Recommendation
* Number = Sequential number corresponding to that of the document section

### 6.1 International scene

Efforts to showcase the commitment of Malaysia towards the UNGPs, especially in the emerging sector of technology, would be favorable to Malaysia‚Äôs international image.

#### 6.1.1 UN‚Äôs Universal Periodic Review

\[OTHR.6.1.1.1] Include (Data-Centric) Digital Rights in subsequent UPRs.

This mention would include Malaysia‚Äôs commitment to protect citizen‚Äôs rights and those of their data as well as an evaluation of the status of the NAP, in particular in the Tech sector.

#### 6.1.2 International participation

\[OTHR.6.1.2.1] Encourage the presence of Malaysian technologists in the international scene.

The presence of Malaysian technologists in international fora (authoritative organizations, events, etc.) is not at par with the quality of its professionals.

Through initiatives such as TIOF‚Äôs TechUp, the Malaysian government should invest efforts in supporting its technologists to actively participate in relevant fora and lead the way in the implementation of the UNGPs in the tech sector.

###

### 6.2 Constitutional considerations

A number of relevant considerations are to be studied if Malaysia wishes to prepare itself for its digital future and safeguard its sovereignty through protecting its citizens‚Äô data.

#### 6.2.1 The nature of data

\[OTHR.6.2.1.1] Expand the Constitution to adopt protections over citizens‚Äô data.

Initiate the mechanisms, possibly on the grounds of Article 5.1 Right to Life, to evaluate the feasibility and implications of recognizing the intrinsic link between citizens and their data so that protections upon the latter may be applicable in a more clear manner.&#x20;

\


\[OTHR.6.2.1.2] Establish Connectivity as a Constitutional Right.

Initiate the mechanisms, possibly on the grounds of Article 9.1 Prohibition of banishment and freedom of movement, to evaluate the feasibility and implications of recognizing the implications of not ensuring Connectivity to all citizens in Malaysia‚Äôs digital territory.

### 6.3 Regulations affecting Civil Society&#x20;

\[OTHR.6.3.1] Accelerate/Update legislation enabling the easy creation of NGOs.

A vibrant Tech NGO/CS ecosystem would support Malaysia in its commitment to uphold the UNGPs in the tech sector, creating a differentiated value proposition compared to SEA and globally. This would translate into a positive impact in the implementation of Pillar III by ensuring that there are enough organizations that can support citizens when needed.

### 6.4 Malaysian NAP: Next iterations

\[OTHR.6.4.1] Establish a permanent Technology Committee for the NAP.

Creating a Technology Committee composed by representatives of the Tech sector to be part of the next iterations would allow the necessary support to evaluate the changes, challenges and solutions for the UNGPs in the Tech sector in Malaysia.

## 7. Closing remarks

This Policy Brief attempts to bring attention to the protections that the Malaysian government can deliver to its citizens and their digital twins through the upcoming National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights, especially by focusing on its application in the tech sector.

\


By including technology as a cross-cutting issue in this current NAP cycle and focusing on implementing technological solutions, Malaysia can lead the way both in the SEA region and globally to become an example to follow in how governments can protect the rights of their citizens and of their data.

\


The IO Foundation wishes to emphatically request the Malaysian government and the organizations involved in this NAP process to include technology as a cross-cutting issue and to incorporate as many recommendations herein described as possible.

\


The IO Foundation remains at their disposal for any further consultation and to support the implementation of the recommendations.

\
\
